            <h2>Hi! My name is Muhammad Naim</h2>
            <p>
              I am a passionate Software Engineering student at Universiti Putra Malaysia, specializing in full-stack development. My technical skills include Java, Flutter, Laravel, Node.js, and React. I enjoy building creative digital solutions that enhance everyday life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my academic journey, I have developed various applications such as a UPM Bus Tracking System and several website app such as random password-generator. These projects highlight my ability to merge technical expertise with innovative thinking. I continuously seek challenges that allow me to grow and expand my capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of coding, I am an active runner and enjoy engaging with community. I believe in lifelong learning, continuous improvement, and the power of technology to make meaningful change. My goal is to contribute to impactful projects while becoming a well-rounded software engineer.
